# This should happen on system powerup
PowerOn
	turn PID off
	turn pump off
	turn RIMS relay ON
	display status of all relays
  display status of RIMS

Heat Strike Water
	Confirm strike water is in the mash tun -> response
	confirm return manifold is in the mash tun -> response
	confirm RIMS relay is on - if not, turn on
	turn on pump
	prompt for pump emergency stop (spacebar)
	wait 30 seconds
	confirm that strike water is circulating well -> response
	input volume of water
	input volume of grain
	input desired mash temp
	measure current strike water temp and save
	calculate strike temp
	set PID to strike temp
	when strike temp is reached, sound alarm

Mash
	prompt to enter mash temp -> response
	prompt to enter mash time (min) -> response
	set PID SV to mash temp
	begin mash timer
	when timer expires, sound alarm

Mashout
	prompt to enter mashout temp -> response
	set PID SV to mashout temp
	monitor mash temp
	when mashout temp is reached ->sound alarm

Sparge
	prompt that sparge water is heated to correct temp ->response
	turn on sparge relay
	wait 15 seconds
	turn off RIMS relay (redirects to boil tun)
	prompt to check the sparge balance (OK)
	turn off sparge when boil kettle is at full volume
