# This should happen on system powerup
PowerOn
	turn PID off
	turn pump off
	turn RIMS relay ON
	display status of all relays
  display status of PID/RIMS


# At all times when the PID is on, the pump is on
Heat Strike Water
	Confirm strike water is in the mash tun -> response
	confirm return manifold is in the mash tun -> response
	confirm RIMS relay is on - if not, turn on
	turn on pump
	prompt for pump emergency stop (spacebar)
	wait 30 seconds
	confirm that strike water is circulating well -> response
	calculate strike temp
	measure current strike water temp and save
	calculate strike temp
	set PID to strike temp
	when strike temp is reached, ping slack

Dough In
	turn pump off
	turn PID off
	pour in grain

Mash
	prompt to enter mash temp -> response
	set SV to the mash temp
	prompt to enter mash time (min) -> response # default 60 mins
	confirm RIMS relay set to ON
	# Dont start timer until mash temp is reached
	begin mash timer
	when timer expires, ping slack # manually check for starch

Mashout # same as mash without time # kills the enzymes
	prompt to heat sparge water manually
	prompt to enter mashout temp -> response
	set PID SV to mashout temp
	monitor mash temp
	when mashout temp is reached -> ping slack

Sparge
	prompt that sparge water is heated to correct temp -> response
	turn RIMS relay off (redirect to boil tun)
	turn on sparge relay
	wait 30 seconds
	turn off RIMS relay (redirects to boil tun)
	prompt to check the sparge balance (OK)
	wait until intervention
	turn off PID
	turn off pump
	turn off sparge when boil tun is at full volume

Topping Off
	divert sparge tank to boil
	wait 15
	turn on sparge tank
	wait for intervention to turn off sparge
